# snakegame.py

My first rookie python project done before I entered my college, the classic snake game in python using turtle and freegames libraries in python.

The code is very simple and easy to understand. The snake head is moves on the turtle graphics screen freely, 
it then controlled by the arrow keys so it eats the food square that is randomly placed on the screen, using the random module. 
Each time it eats the food, the snake head increases in length.
If the snake head touches the edges of the game screen it dies or if it touches itself.
